Trying to successfully complete exercises in the C Programming Language book by Kernighan and Ritchie

I'm very new to programming and love it so far. The exercises in this book challenge my mind and give me interest problems to take on. They are actually quite fantastic. 

Usually the top of main.c will include a copy of the exercise text

This is my first Git repository ever, and I'm learning a lot!
